          Hey all! We are building tools to help make learning accessible to
          everyone. Our first is IWTLNOW (IWTL is the commonly used internet
          acronym for I Want To Learn). Learning something from scratch can be
          daunting. ChatGPT and other AI models have now made it easy to ask
          questions about just about anything and learn.

          As revolutionary as they are, a chat interface is too linear and
          tedious to learn any reasonably complex idea or concept. They tend to
          be multi-dimensional, and chat isn't great to handle that.
        </div>
        <div>
          We are making IWTLNOW a hybrid mind-mapping tool with a rich interface
          to help learners explore directions, at different levels, access
          resources, and test their understanding - all in one place.
